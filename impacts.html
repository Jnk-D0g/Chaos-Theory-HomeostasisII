        <h1>Bill Summary</h1>
        <p>
            This bill would mainly impact politicians and campaigning staff that manage finances. But also in a broader sense it could possibly affect the entirety of the campaigning system in northern Virginia, because the J.L.A.R.C would have the right to implement any changes that they would find necessary. It would mostly benefit the campaign system because any legal, technical, financing, and staffing shortcomings would be identified and a solution would be made to improve the current issue.

        <p>
            Study; JLARC; Virginia's campaign finance laws; report. Directs the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) to study Virginia's campaign finance laws. In its study, JLARC is directed to (i) identify any legal, technical, and staffing shortcomings in the current election and campaign finance laws relating to (a) reporting and investigating violations, (b) enforcing legal and regulatory requirements, and (c) implementing directions from state government at the local level and (ii) determine whether current budgetary allocations are sufficient to effectively carry out such aspects of the campaign finance system. To that end, JLARC is directed to analyze how existing campaign finance and election laws can be modernized to increase transparency and accountability using best practices from other jurisdictions across the United States and to produce a report of clear recommendations and best practices for improving the current system(“SJ255Virginia’s Campaign Finance Laws; Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to Study.” Lis, lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SJ255.14 Feb. 2025).
